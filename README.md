# Trading Journal

This repository documents my personal development as a trader with a focus on **price action**, **market structure**, and **Fair Value Gaps (FVG)**.  
I'm building this journal as both a reflection of my learning and a toolkit to track strategy evolution and decision-making.

## What I'm Learning

I'm currently focused on the following areas:

- Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) — identifying imbalances between buyers and sellers  
- Market structure shifts — understanding BOS/CHoCH and trend reversals  
- Liquidity zones — identifying where liquidity is likely to be taken  
- Institutional order flow — learning how "smart money" operates  
- Candle behavior — reading wicks, bodies, and volume reactions  
- Entry/exit precision — using confluence to refine setups

## Why This Journal Matters

Trading requires more than intuition — it demands **documentation, reflection, and refinement**.  
By analyzing trades with structured criteria, I aim to:

- Avoid emotional decisions  
- Track performance patterns  
- Refine strategy based on recurring behaviors  
- Build a system based on probability, not luck

## What I’m Currently Working On

- Backtesting high-probability setups using FVG + liquidity sweep confluence  
- Journaling trades daily to evaluate entry/exit decisions  
- Studying volume shifts and displacement candles in trending environments  
- Learning how to manage trades using partials, break-even strategies, and higher timeframe alignment

---

## Next Steps

- Add screenshots and trade breakdowns  
- Create a tagging system to label confluence factors  
- Automate basic journaling through Notion or Google Sheets  
- Link this journal to other studies (liquidity, entries, news catalysts)
