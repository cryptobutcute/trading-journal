# Trading Journal
I'm currently deepening my knowledge in trading with a focus on price action, market structure and Fair Value Gaps (FVG).  
This repository is where I organize my observations, trading concepts and strategies, especially related to liquidity, imbalance and high-probability setups using FVGs.  
I'm also exploring how institutional order flow and algorithmic behavior influence price movements.
